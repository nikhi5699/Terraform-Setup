# 🚀 Jenkins Infrastructure Setup for Python REST API Deployment

This repository provisions the AWS Cloud infrastructure required to create **Jenkins host server** using Terraform. The Jenkins server is configured to integrate with a separate Git repository that contains Terraform code for deploying a **Python REST API application**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project includes:

- 🔧 Infrastructure setup for Jenkins (on AWS EC2)
- ⚙️ Jenkins configuration to:
  - Pull Terraform code from an external Git repository -** Link to be added soon**
  - Provision Cloud infrastructure (VPC, other Networking components, Hosted Zone for DNS, Certificate using AWS Certificate Manager, EC2, RDS, Load Balancer)
  - Deploy a Python-based REST API application

- ## 📋 Prerequisites
